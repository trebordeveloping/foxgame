# foxgame

This is a crappy version of Google Chrome's dinosaur game.
It is made with pygame.

I have 3 programs:
    a file with the main program,
    a file containing the classes initialised in the main program, and
    a file containing a class with colours.

It isn't really playable:
    the hitbox is a single coordinate,
    the obstacles get too fast too quickly, and
    the sprite sizes aren't perfected.
